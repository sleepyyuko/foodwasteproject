    <h1>Reducing Food Waste: Simple Steps</h1>
    <p>
      Food waste is a big issue, but there are easy ways to make a difference
      right at home. By being more mindful of how we buy, store, and use food,
      we can save money and help the planet.

 <div class="planning">
    <h2>Plan Your Meals</h2>
    <p>
      Before you shop, take a few minutes to plan your meals for the week. This
      helps you buy only what you need and avoids impulse purchases that might
      go bad.
    </p>

 <div class="smartstorage">
    <h2>Smart Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Knowing how to store different foods can extend their life. For example,
      some fruits and vegetables last longer in the fridge, while others prefer
      the counter. Look up storage tips for specific items.
    </p>
</div>
    
 <div class="understanding">
    <h2>Understand Dates</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>"Best before"</strong> and <strong>"use by"</strong> dates mean
      different things. "Best before" is about quality, so food might still be
      safe to eat after this date. "Use by" is about safety, so it's best to eat
      or freeze food before this date.
    </p>
 </div>
  <div class="love">
    <h2>Love Your Leftovers</h2>
    <p>
      Don't let leftovers go to waste! Get creative and turn them into new
      meals, or simply enjoy them the next day for lunch. Proper storage in
      airtight containers keeps them fresh.
    </p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="compost">
 <h2>Compost When Possible</h2>
    <p>
      Even with our best efforts, some food waste is unavoidable. Composting
      food scraps like fruit peels and vegetable trimmings helps return
      nutrients to the soil and reduces landfill waste.
