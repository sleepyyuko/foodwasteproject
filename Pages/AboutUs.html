  <h2>About Our Organization</h2>
  <p>
    We are Cloud 9, a passionate and friendly team who truly care about the problem of food waste. Every day, huge amounts of perfectly good food are thrown away all around the world. This not only wastes valuable resources like water, energy, and land but also harms our planet by creating unnecessary pollution. At Cloud 9, we believe it’s very important to save food and use it wisely so we can protect the Earth for future generations. Our goal is to help everyone, young and old, understand why reducing food waste matters, and to share simple ideas, useful tips, and fun activities that make a real difference in cutting down food waste in homes, schools, and communities everywhere.

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Cloud 9 began in 2022 when we noticed just how much food was being wasted around us — in kitchens, cafeterias, and shops. We thought this was sad because so many people don’t realize how easy and enjoyable it can be to save food instead of throwing it away. We wanted to create a group where people could come together to learn about food waste and discover practical ways to prevent it. That’s why Cloud 9 was born — to teach everyone, especially families and schools, how to save food through simple actions like better shopping, storing food properly, and making delicious meals from leftovers. Since then, we’ve been spreading the word, inspiring people to join us in making small changes that add up to big improvements for our planet.

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Our vision is a bright and hopeful world where no good food ever goes to waste and where everyone knows how valuable food really is. We dream of a future where families, schools, and businesses work together to protect the environment by using food carefully and thoughtfully. We imagine communities filled with people who care deeply about the planet and choose to reduce waste every day, helping to save water, energy, and money. At Cloud 9, we believe that by working together, we can create a cleaner, greener, and happier world for ourselves and for all living things.

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to educate and empower people of all ages about the problem of food waste and how to prevent it. We want to share easy, creative, and fun ideas to save food and encourage everyone to take action in their own homes and communities. Whether it’s learning how to plan meals better, store food safely, or get creative with leftovers, we want to help people make smart choices that reduce waste. Cloud 9 is dedicated to building a kind and caring community where people support each other in making the world a better place — one small step at a time — by wasting less food and protecting our planet for the future.
