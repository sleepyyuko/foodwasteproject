    <h2>Causes of Food Waste</h2>
   
  <p>Food waste happens for many reasons across the food supply chain. People often buy more food than needed due to poor planning or impulse shopping. Improper storage causes food to spoil quickly, and confusion over expiration dates leads to perfectly good food being thrown away. Large portion sizes and uneaten leftovers add to the waste. Many reject fruits and vegetables that look imperfect, even though they are edible. Food can also be lost during harvesting, transportation, and in restaurants due to over-preparation or poor inventory management. Overall, a lack of awareness about the impact of food waste contributes to careless habits, making it a serious problem worldwide.
  
  </p>
  
 
 
  <h2>Consequences of Food Waste</h2>
 
  <p>Food waste has several serious consequences. Environmentally, it leads to unnecessary use of resources like water, land, and energy, and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions when food decomposes in landfills. Economically, wasting food means losing money spent on production, transportation, and storage. Socially, food waste is especially troubling when millions of people around the world face hunger and food insecurity. Additionally, managing food waste creates extra costs for communities and puts pressure on waste disposal systems. Overall, food waste negatively impacts the environment, economy, and society.
 
  </p>
 
  <h2>Facts</h2>
  <p>
    About one-third of all food produced worldwideâ€”around 1.3 billion tonsâ€”is wasted each year. This waste contributes to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a major factor in climate change. While millions of people suffer from hunger, households alone are responsible for nearly half of the food waste in many countries. Fruits and vegetables are wasted the most, and the global economic loss from food waste is estimated at about $1 trillion annually. Reducing food waste by just a quarter could help feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide.
  </p>
 
  <h2>Ways to Reduce Food Waste</h2>
 
  <p>
    To reduce food waste, itâ€™s important to plan meals carefully and shop only for what you need. Properly storing food helps keep it fresh longer, while understanding expiration dates can prevent throwing away food that is still safe to eat. Cooking the right portion sizes and using leftovers creatively can also minimize waste. Buying imperfect fruits and vegetables, which are often discarded despite being edible, helps reduce unnecessary waste. Donating excess food to those in need and composting food scraps instead of sending them to landfills are additional effective steps. Finally, raising awareness about the impact of food waste encourages more mindful habits in families and communities.
  </p>
 
  <h2>Government Roles</h2>
 
  <p>
    Governments play a crucial role in reducing food waste through policies, regulations, and public campaigns. They can set standards for food labeling to reduce confusion over expiration dates and promote better food storage and handling practices. Governments often support food donation programs by providing legal protections and incentives to encourage businesses and individuals to donate surplus food. They also invest in improving infrastructure, such as transportation and storage facilities, especially in developing regions, to reduce losses in the supply chain. Public awareness campaigns and educational programs led by governments help inform citizens about the importance of minimizing food waste. Additionally, some governments implement waste reduction targets and work with industries to create more sustainable food systems.
