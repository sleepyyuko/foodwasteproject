      <h2>What is Food Waste?</h2>
      <div class="whatisit">
        <div class="retail">
      <p>
        Food waste refers to food that is discarded or lost uneaten. This occurs
        at various stages of the food supply chain, from production and
        processing to retail and consumption in our homes.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
         Food Loss: Occurs in the supply chain between harvest
          and retail.
        </li>
        <li>
          Food Waste: Occurs at the retail and consumer levels.
        </li>

      <h2>The Environmental Impact</h2>
      <div class="sig">
      <p>Food waste has significant negative impacts on our planet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Decomposing food in
          landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wasted Resources:</strong> The production of food requires
          vast amounts of land, water, energy, and labor. When food is wasted,
          these resources are also wasted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Landfill Overcrowding:</strong> Food waste contributes
          significantly to the volume of waste in landfills.

      <h2>The Economic Impact</h2>
      <div class="beyond">
      <p>
        Beyond the environmental concerns, food waste also has substantial
        economic consequences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Financial Losses for Consumers:</strong> Buying food that ends
          up being thrown away is a direct financial loss for households.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Losses for Businesses:</strong> Retailers and food service
          providers incur costs related to unsold and discarded food.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inefficient Supply Chains:</strong> Food loss in the early
          stages can lead to higher prices and food insecurity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Social and Ethical Implications</h2>
      <div class="world">
      <p>
        In a world where many people face hunger, the amount of food wasted
        raises serious ethical questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Food Insecurity:</strong> Reducing food waste could help make
          more food available to those who need it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moral Responsibility:</strong> There's a moral imperative to
          use resources efficiently and avoid unnecessary waste.
        </li>
      </ul>
