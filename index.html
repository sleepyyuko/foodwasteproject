    <h2>Why is Food Waste a Problem?</h2>
    <p>Food waste has significant environmental, economic, and social consequences...</p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Food waste is an international issue with environmental, economic, and societal effects. When food is wasted, all the resources that are spent making it—water, energy, land, and labor—are also wasted. As food rots in landfills, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that leads to climate change. Food waste has a monetary effect of more than $1 trillion every year on the globe, affecting farmers, companies, and consumers. Socially, it highlights a gross imbalance: as one-third of total food produced is wasted, millions across the world are still suffering from hunger and malnutrition. Not wasting food is essential in order to save the planet, cut costs, and ensure everyone has access to food.</h4>
